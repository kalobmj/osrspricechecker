To build an OSRS price grabber with a search bar that provides a dropdown of all in-game items, and displays the item's image and current Grand Exchange (GE) price upon selection, you'll need to utilize specific APIs. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. Fetching Item Data
**a. Item List with IDs and Names:

Purpose: To populate the search bar's dropdown with all item names and their corresponding IDs.
API Endpoint:
URL: https://prices.runescape.wiki/api/v1/osrs/mapping
Description: This endpoint provides a comprehensive list of OSRS items, including their IDs, names, and other metadata.
**b. Current Item Prices:

Purpose: To retrieve the latest GE prices for items.
API Endpoint:
URL: https://prices.runescape.wiki/api/v1/osrs/latest
Description: This endpoint returns the most recent prices for items, indexed by their item IDs.
**c. Item Images:

Purpose: To display the item's image alongside its price.
Image URL Pattern:
URL Format: https://secure.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/obj_big.gif?id=ITEM_ID
Description: Replace ITEM_ID with the actual item ID to get the item's image.
2. Implementing the Search Functionality
**a. Populate the Search Dropdown:

Fetch the Item List:
Use the /mapping endpoint to retrieve all item names and IDs.
Display in Dropdown:
Populate the search bar's dropdown with the item names.
Allow users to type and filter items dynamically.
**b. Handle User Selection:

On Item Selection or Search:
Capture the selected item's name or the user's input.
Find the Corresponding Item ID:
Match the item name to its ID using the data from the /mapping endpoint.
3. Displaying Item Details
**a. Fetch and Display Item Price:

Retrieve Price:
Use the /latest endpoint to get the current price for the item ID.
Display Price:
Show the item's current GE price on the page.
**b. Fetch and Display Item Image:

Construct Image URL:
Replace ITEM_ID in the image URL pattern with the actual item ID.
Display Image:
Show the item's image alongside its price.

The links I provided are from the Old School RuneScape (OSRS) Price API, which is an open, community-supported API maintained by the team at prices.runescape.wiki. This website is dedicated to tracking and providing real-time data for OSRS Grand Exchange prices.

Here's how I found them and why they are relevant:

1. OSRS Wiki API Documentation
The prices.runescape.wiki API is well-documented and is widely used by developers for OSRS-related projects. You can access their documentation at:

Documentation URL:
https://prices.runescape.wiki/

This documentation explains the available endpoints, how to use them, and what data they return. Itâ€™s the primary source for fetching item mappings, current prices, and historical trends.

2. API Endpoints Breakdown
The endpoints I shared are the main ones for fetching data:

Mapping Endpoint (Item List):

URL: https://prices.runescape.wiki/api/v1/osrs/mapping
This endpoint provides a list of all items, their IDs, names, and metadata.
Useful for populating dropdowns, search bars, or item selection features.
Latest Prices Endpoint:

URL: https://prices.runescape.wiki/api/v1/osrs/latest
Provides up-to-date Grand Exchange prices for items, indexed by their IDs.
Useful for displaying current market prices.
Item Images (Official OSRS Site):

Image URL Pattern:
https://secure.runescape.com/m=itemdb_oldschool/obj_big.gif?id=ITEM_ID
These images are hosted on the official Old School RuneScape Grand Exchange site. By replacing ITEM_ID with a valid item ID, you can fetch the item's image.
How I Found Them
Exploring OSRS Resources:

The OSRS Wiki is a central hub for RuneScape-related information, and they host the price API as part of their resources for the community.
Developer Communities:

Many developers working on RuneScape-related tools (e.g., price checkers, calculators, or plugins) use this API and recommend it in forums like Reddit or GitHub repositories.
Direct Documentation Access:

The API's documentation explicitly lists these endpoints, making them reliable and official.
Why Use This API?
It is accurate and up-to-date, relying on real-time data from the OSRS Grand Exchange.
It is free and open for the community, with clear usage guidelines.
It provides both comprehensive item metadata (from /mapping) and current prices (from /latest), making it ideal for projects like price checkers.
