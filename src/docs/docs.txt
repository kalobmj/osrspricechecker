    change color of price based on how much it is
        red
        white
        blue
        use runelite spotlight colors
    work on three color scheme themes
    have different colors use a different main container color scheme with repeating icon icons slanted in the underlay, ie whips
        1. whips red brown linear gradient // diff patterns? slanted? swirls? 
        2. dds red green linear gradient
        3. santa hats white red linear gradient
        ags too, with same yellow blue gradient for arma colors
    consider having a different background with each color option
        have these different background and body backgrounds stored in state that styles inline style={{}}
